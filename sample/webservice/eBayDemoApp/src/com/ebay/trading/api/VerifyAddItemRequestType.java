/**
 * 
 * Enables a seller to specify the definition of a new item and submit the definition to eBay without creating a listing.&nbsp;<b>Also for Half.com</b>.
 * <br><br>
 * Sellers who engage in cross-border trade on sites that require a recoupment agreement, must agree to the
 * recoupment terms before adding or verifying items. This agreement allows eBay to reimburse
 * a buyer during a dispute and then recoup the cost from the seller. The US site is a recoupment site, and
 *         the agreement is located <a href="https://scgi.ebay.com/ws/eBayISAPI.dll?CBTRecoupAgreement">here</a>.
 *         The list of the sites where a user has agreed to the recoupment terms is returned by the GetUser response.
