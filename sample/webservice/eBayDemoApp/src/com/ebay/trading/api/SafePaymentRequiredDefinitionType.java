/**
 * 
 * For the US, Canada and Australia sites, users registered after January 17,2007 are
 * required to offer at least one safe payment method (i.e. PayPal/PaisaPay, or one
 * of the credit cards specified in Item.PaymentMethods).
 * <br>
 * If a seller has a 'SafePaymentExempt' status, they are exempt from the category
 * requirement to offer at least one safe payment method when listing an item on a
 * site that has the safe payment requirement.
 * <br>
 * The safe payment requirement also applies to two-category listings that have one
 * ship-to or available-to location in the US, Canada, or Australia. The French
 * Canadian (CAFR) site is a special case, because listings on the CAFR site with
 * ship-to or available-to locations in Canada do not require a Safe Payment method,
 * yet listings on the CAFR site with ship-to or available-to locations in the US or
 * Australia do require a safe payment method.
 * <br>
 * The Business and Industrial, Motors, Real Estate, and Mature Audiences categories,
 * and all listings that don't support Item.PaymentMethods are exempt from this
 * requirement. Therefore, listings in those categories do not require a safe payment
 * method.
 * <br>
 * Currently, this field contains no other special meta-data.(An empty element is
 * returned.)
 * <br>
 * Use SiteDefaults.SafePaymentRequired and Category.SafePaymentRequired to determine
 * which categories require a safe payment method.
