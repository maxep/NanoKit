   * to 400 px on their longest side (maintaining their original aspect ratio).
   * <br><br>
   * Note that you can use the Gallery Plus feature whether or not the image is hosted with
   * eBay Picture Services (EPS). One EPS image is included at no cost with the Gallery Plus
   * feature.
   * <br><br>
   * When "Plus" is included in an item listing, the listing also automatically gets the

   * ES (site ID 186), FR (site ID 71), IT (site ID 101),and NL (site ID 146).
   * <br><br>
   * On these sites (starting on the same production date), whenever Plus is selected
   * in a request that specifies at least two eBay Picture Services (EPS) hosted
   * images (using ItemType.PictureDetailsType.PictureURL), the Gallery Plus feature
   * now automatically includes a Gallery Showcase of all the listing's
   * images at no extra cost. If Plus is selected and the request includes only one
   * EPS image or any self-hosted images, regular Gallery Plus applies.
   * <br><br>
   * The Gallery Showcase displays when mousing over or clicking on the listing's Gallery
   * Plus icon in the search results. The Showcase window displays a large
   * (400 px x 400 px) preview image which is usually the first specified
   * PictureURL, as well as up to four (64 px x 64 px) selectable
   * thumbnails for the remaining EPS images (the Showcase window contains
   * pagination controls for observing all EPS images in the request).
   * Clicking on the preview image displays the item's listing page.
   * <br><br>
   * When using RelistItem or ReviseItem (item has no bids and more than
   * 12 hours before the listing's end), Plus can be unselected in
   * the request. However, the Plus fee will still apply if a previous
   * request selected Plus. There is at most one Plus fee per listing.
