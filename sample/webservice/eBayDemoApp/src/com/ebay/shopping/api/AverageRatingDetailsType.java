 * Applicable to sites that support the Detailed Seller Ratings feature.
 * The AverageRatingDetailsType contains the average detailed seller ratings in an area. When buyers leave an overall Feedback rating (positive, neutral, or negative) for a seller, they also can leave ratings in four areas: item as described, communication, shipping time, and charges for shipping and handling. Users retrieve detailed ratings as averages of the ratings left by buyers.
